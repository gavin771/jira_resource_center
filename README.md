# QW Resource Center

A sample react project created following Jesse Weigel's [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkxYR9ly9ksx8UYyCpBRmMc)
I'm attempting to create a resource centre for my company that will also have a style guide, logos, templates and integrate with my Trello.

For this implementation, I'm using [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and some of the functionalities are not exactly the same as Jesse's project.

Project being hosted on [Github Pages](https://gavin771.github.io/qw_resource_center/)


(More details to this will be added as i progress :) )
