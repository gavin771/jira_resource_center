# JIRA Resource Center

A sample react project created following Jesse Weigel's [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkxYR9ly9ksx8UYyCpBRmMc)

For this implementation, I'm using [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) and the functionalities are not exactly the same.

Project being hosted on [Github Pages](https://gavin771.github.io/jira_resource_center/)


(More details to this will be added as i progress :) )
